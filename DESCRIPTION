Description: Provides a two-stage framework for multiple testing problems with 
    topological constraints. In the first stage, clusters of hypotheses are 
    selected as regions of interests. The clusters can be overlapped. The false
    overlapped-cluster rate w.r.t. the clusters is controlled. In the second
    stage, conditional p-values are calculated at the individual level in a 
    post-selection inference fashion. The FDR controlling procedures are applied
    to these conditional p-values. 
    Two functions are proposed: 'focr_initial' and 'focr'. The function 'focr' 
    provides a bundled stage-I and stage-II procedure with preset settings. 
    The function 'focr_initial' only controls the stage-I 'FOCR' and calculate
    the conditional p-values. However, it allows more flexible controls on the 
    clusters.
